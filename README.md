ParallelOffset_plugin
======================

Code repository for a QGIS plugin that creates a parallel line to a selected line feature.

In order for this plugin to work you need to have a polyline layer selected in the layer list and 1 or more feature selected from the active layer.  Then you simply specify the type of offset you want and the distance from the dialog box.  Press ok and a temporary layer is created for you to do as you please with.
